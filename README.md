# Swinging Up a Pendulum by Energy Control  
**Based on the Research Paper by K.J. Åström and K. Furuta**  

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of the concepts presented in the research paper by K.J. Åström and K. Furuta.  

## Project Overview  
- **Detailed Report:**  
  The project includes a report containing the complete derivations of the equations discussed in the paper. It explains the origin of these equations and how they are derived step-by-step.  

- **MATLAB Code:**  
  The implementation code is located in the `matlab_codes` folder.  
  Each behavior of the pendulum described in the paper, such as:  
  - **Single Swing Double Switch**  
  - **Single Swing Triple Switch**
  - **Multi Swing Multi Switch**  
  and more, is implemented and documented in detail to match the theoretical descriptions.  

## How to Use  
1. **Read the Report:**  
   Gain a deeper understanding of the mathematical derivations and the control principles.  

2. **Run the Code:**  
   Navigate to the `matlab_codes` folder to experiment with and visualize the pendulum behaviors.
